            <h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
            My name is Bert, and I am an aspiring voice artist and telecommunication engineer based in London, UK. I specialize in Analog to VoIP System Migration and VoIP (Voice Over IP) systems.
<br><br>
I was born 4 months early in December 2004 in the Neonatal Unit at St George’s Hospital. I was diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism at around 6 years old.
<br><br>
When I was five, I started primary school at a mainstream school which I left due to my behavior. I don’t remember much from there but I can remember a few things. I was a sheep in the school play and wanted to be the star of the show, so I moved about a lot.
<br><br>
I was put on the naughty “step” but when my dad came to pick me up, I wanted to stay on the naughty “step” and continue my train of thought.
<br><br>
I went to the “school disco” which had 1 light, 2 little speakers and a whole lot of 60s music (in 2010). I know what a bad disco looks like because my dad owns a mobile disco company called Disco And Balloons (He started doing discos in the 70s with his friend and set up the company later).
<br><br>
In 2013 when I was seven, I moved to an SEN Primary School in Croydon where I spent from year 3 to year 6. At first, I misbehaved but in about 2 weeks my behavior had completely changed.
<br><br>
In 2016 when I was eleven, I went to an SEN high school which goes from ages of 7 up to 18. A brief summary of my year 7: I had a teacher that would be off for a month, so we had a supply teacher who then became our full-time teacher because it turned out she did not come back.
<br><br>
In 2021 when I was sixteen, I moved up to the 6th form in the computing pathway, Where I stated playing at lunch times 2 days a week, for the first year of 6th form WEX on a Wednesday and a half day on a friday also I did not have any work expirence for that year and a little into the next, Year 13 (2022) the work experience day was changed to friday and the half day was remove.
<br><br>
                and now it's 2023 and i'm planing to go to NECOT College
                <br><br>
